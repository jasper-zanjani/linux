<!-- 
When I created this doc I need some place to put GNU Stow.
I imagine this would focus on all the common terminal-based utilities
that make Linux a machine for productivity.

- "Suckless" utilities
- Tiling window managers and tmux
- Vim, Neovim, Emacs
- Terminal-based file managers and other utilities
