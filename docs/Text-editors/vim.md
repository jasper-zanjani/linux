#### Formatting characters

```vim
" Toggle visibilty of formatting characters (whitespace, etc)
set list!

" Customize characters displayed to represent classes of formatting characters
set listchars=space:Â·
```

List characters are governed by the **SpecialKey** highlight group, although other groups like **Whitespace** also appear to work.

The tilde character used to fill lines at the end of files is its own highlight group, although it usually links to NonText.

```vim
highlight EndOfBuffer ctermfg=Black
```
