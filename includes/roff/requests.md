The directives that roff uses to specify formatting are properly called _requests_.
Requests begin with a period `.` and often appear on their own line alone or followed by arguments, depending on how they are used.
Requests that appear inline with text are called _embedded requests_ or _escape sequences_ and usually begin with backslash `\`.
