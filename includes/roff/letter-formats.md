Various letter formats:

#### Full block format

All components of the letter are aligned to the left and the body of the letter paragraphs are not indented.

#### Modified block format

Heading, complimentary close, signature, and identification are aligned to the right and body paragraphs are indented.

_College Typewriting_ describes the placement of these components as being "tabulated to center" with _open punctuation_ (no punctuation after salutation and complimentary close), and body paragraphs are not indented.
