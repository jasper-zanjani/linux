And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me‐‐filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"’Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door‐‐
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;
This it is and nothing more."
