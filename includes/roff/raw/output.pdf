          Dear Mr. Rodriguez

          Let  me  tell  you again how pleased we were with our tour of the
          South Pacific, Tour 1022.  It was a fantastic experience.

          Helping to make it so was your efficient tour director,  Mr.  Le‐
          land  Hopkins.   He  was a superb guide, well organized, clear in
          explanations, and pleasant.  He got us through customs and  immi‐
          gration quickly and painlessly.

          We  saw  all the features advertised for the tour‐‐and then some.
          We had preferential seating at most of the special events.  There
          were very few commercial stops.  All these things we  like  about
          the tour and Mr. Hopkins.

          Soon we plan to take a trip to South America.  If you have a tour
          of  interesting places there, I should appreciate your sending me
          information on it.

                                           Your sincerely



                                           Harold Thiel
