And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
.br
Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
.br
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
.br
"'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door--
.br
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;
.br
This it is and nothing more."
