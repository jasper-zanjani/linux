# Typing

-   [tt](https://github.com/lemnos/tt) - Terminal based typing test written in Go. 
    Errors on build and appears to be out of maintenance.
    Allows you to provide custom word files.

-   [toipe](https://github.com/Samyak2/toipe) - Terminal based typing test written in Rust.
    Also allows custom word lists but apparently with some restrictions.
