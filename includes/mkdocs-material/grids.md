An unordered list placed within a **div.grid.cards** will be rendered as grid cards.

```html
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   Lorem ipsum...

</div>
```

Place markdown blocks within a div marked by the **grid** class to have each block takes its own grid space.

```html
<div class="grid" markdown>

</div>
```
