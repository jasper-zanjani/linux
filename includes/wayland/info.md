[**Wayland**](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) is a [display server protocol](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wayland) and intended to become the successor for the [X Window System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/X_Window_System).
It has been made the default display server protocol in GNOME, but KDE still uses X11 by default.
