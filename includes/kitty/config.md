[Kitty configuration](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/) is done mostly in **$HOME/.config/kitty/kitty.conf**, which can be opened within kitty using the keyboard shortcut ++ctrl++++shift++++f2++.

However, configuration is probably preferable through the built-in **kitten** TUI utility, which accepts various commands like `themes` and `choose-fonts`.

```kitty title="kitty.conf"
--8<-- "includes/kitty/kitty.conf"
```
