Unlike WYSIWYG editors which optimize input for writing text, vim optimizes for editing it.
Vim offers a composable language for expressing these editing changes whose syntax can be composed into two elements, operations and text objects, which are analogous to verbs and nouns in language.

The framework of understanding vim's syntax as a language appears to date back to an influential 2011 Stack Overflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118 "What is your most productive shortcut with Vim?").

On Unix-derived operating systems the main config file for Vim is placed at **$HOME/.vimrc**.
On Windows it is placed at **$HOME/\_vimrc**.
