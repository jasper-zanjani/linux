Panes are referred to as "splits" and are controlled by a variety of [bindings](https://vimtricks.com/p/vim-move-split/).

- `sp` or `split` will open a horizontal split (i.e. a split to the top or bottom)
- `vs` or `vsplit` will open a vertical split
- `vert` will open a help query in a vertical split
