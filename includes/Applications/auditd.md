The Linux Audit daemon **auditd** is a component of the [Linux Auditing System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Audit_framework), which reliably collects security-relevant events on a system.

Viewing logs is done with **ausearch** or **aureport**.
Configuring the audit system is done with **auditctl**.
