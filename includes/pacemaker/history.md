An open-source two-node cluster manager named Heartbeat was released by Bell Labs' Alan Robertson in 1998.

Heartbeat's cluster resource manager was spun off into Pacemaker in 2008.

Corosync spun off from OpenAIS, the implementation of API standards that had been set by a consortium of companies and released in 2004.

By 2015, development had ceased on Heartbeat itself and the [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux-HA) had converged on the Corosync-Pacemaker stack.
