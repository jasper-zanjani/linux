**Filesystem access control lists (FACL)** allow you to grant permissions to more than one group, i.e. in cases where more than one department of a corporation needs access to the same files.  
They are made up of _access control entries_ (ACE). 
FACL permissions will be indicated in a `ls -l` command by the presence of a "+" appended to the file permissions. 
**Acl** is a dependency of `systemd`.

To enable it, add ",acl" to options in `fstab` file, then mount/unmount disk. If enabling FACL on root partition, system has to be rebooted.
