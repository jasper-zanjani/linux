The motion keys form the most common patterns used for actions, acting on the entire line, word, until whitespace, etc.

The [**operate until pattern**](https://vimtricks.com/p/vimtrick-operate-until-pattern/) allows an action to take place until a given pattern is found.

- **dtX** delete until `X`
- **cfX** change until (and including) character X
- **d/foo** delete until "foo" is found
