=== "History"

    -   DNF (Dandified YUM) was introduced in 2013 for Fedora 18 as a replacement for yum, which was criticized for poor performance, high memory usage, and slow dependency resolution.
    -   DNF5, which ported libdnf to C++, was first released in 2023 and is the default package manager for Fedora since Fedora Linux 41.
