The configuration file is TOML format and located at **~/.config/helix/config.toml**

[Smart-tab](https://docs.helix-editor.com/editor.html#editorsmart-tab-section), enabled by default, has bizarre functionality and is better disabled.

```toml title="Disable smart-tab"
[editor.smart-tab]
enable = false
```
