- AIX Version 3 was released n 1990 for the POWER-based [RS/6000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RS/6000) platform, also based on RISC architecture, and which was eventually renamed IBM Power Systems.
- AIX Version 4 was released in 1994. Version 4.1 was used as the basis for the Apple Network Server line.

The [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC) ISA is a RISC architecture introduced by an industrial alliance between Apple, IBM, and Motorola and based on the earlier [IBM POWER architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_POWER_architecture).
POWER is an acronym for "Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC".
It is well known as being the architecture behind Apple's desktop and laptop computers from 1994 until 2006.

IBM POWER architecture was abandoned in the late 1990s when IBM used the PowerPC ISA for the [POWER3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER3) processor.

PowerPC evolved into Power ISA v3.0 in 2006 and is now governed by the [OpenPOWER Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenPOWER_Foundation), which in turn became part of the Linux Foundation in 2019.
