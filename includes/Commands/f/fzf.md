Keybindings are provided by bash scripts in **/usr/share/fzf** which can be sourced by bash, zsh, or fish.
These files provide several new [keybindings](https://thevaluable.dev/fzf-shell-integration/):

- ++ctrl+r++ fuzzy find shell command history
- ++alt+c++ fuzzy find all subdirectories of the working directory, running cd with the selection
- ++ctrl+t++ fuzzy find all files and subdirectories of the working directory, outputting the selection to STDOUT
