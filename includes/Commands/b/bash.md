=== "for"

    The body of all loops is bracketed between **do** and **done**.

    <div class="grid cards" markdown>

    -   Sequences of numbers can be generated by placing a number range between single braces

        ```sh
        for i in {01..07}
        do 
            # Doing stuff...
        done
        ```

    -   Spaces delimit elements of an array

        ```sh
        for i in 1 2 3 4 5
        do 
            # Doing stuff...
        done
        ```


    -   Extracting audio from mp4 files in the current working directory

        ```sh
        for f in *.mp4
        do 
            ffmpeg -i $f ${f/.mp4/.wav} 
        done
        ```

    -   Traditional C-style for loop

        ```sh
        for ((i=0; i<N; i++))
        do 
            # Doing stuff...
        done
        ```

    </div>

=== "set"

    ```sh
    # Enable debugging mode in the shebang of a script
    #!/usr/bin/env bash +x

    # Enable debugging mode in a script
    set +x

    # Vi mode: press V in normal mode to open a file editor
    set -o vi
    ```

=== "shopt"

    ```sh
    # Disable case sensitivity
    shopt -s nocasematch

    # Navigate to directories without typing them
    shopt -s autocd
    ```

=== ":material-wrench: Config"

    - **/etc/profile** is the system config

    - **$HOME/.bashrc** and **$HOME/.bash_profile** are the user configs

    - Some distributions put additional configs in **$HOME/.bashrc.d/** but these are loaded by **source** statements within the bashrc.

=== ":material-keyboard: Keybindings"

    Keybindings are supported by the **bind** internal command.
    This is used to great effect in **fzf**'s [keybinding scripts](https://thevaluable.dev/fzf-shell-integration/).
