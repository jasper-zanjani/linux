The fastboot menu is accessible by holding Volume Down during boot.
This is only possible after enabling **OEM unlocking** from within the operating system's settings.
Once this is done, the bootloader can be [unlocked](https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader) from the fastboot menu.

This is necessary when flashing operatings systems, either replacing stock Android with [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/) or [reinstalling stock Android](https://flash.android.com/).
